# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-NLP-

#Features:
Twitter Data Collection: Tweets are collected from Twitter's public API based on specific search queries or hashtags related to the topic of interest.
Preprocessing: Text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization are applied to clean and standardize the tweet text.
Feature Extraction: Features are extracted from the preprocessed tweet text, which may include word frequencies, n-grams, or word embeddings.
Model Training: Machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are trained on labeled tweet data to predict sentiment labels.
Evaluation: The performance of the trained models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#Technologies Used:
Python: Used as the primary programming language for data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
